# AutoHome Smart Thermostat
Smart Thermostat written in python for Raspberry Pi

I wanted to create a project so that I could learn the python programming language and have something useful when I am done.  With that being said, this is NOT well written code (there are probably better ways to do what I am doing) but I am using it to learn.
